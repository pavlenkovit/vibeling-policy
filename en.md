# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how VibeLing (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the VibeLing mobile application (the “App”).

## Information We Collect
VibeLing does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your name, phone number, or email address.  
We also do not request access to your contacts, camera, or location data.

However, some anonymized usage data (such as device type, app version, and crash reports) may be automatically collected by Apple or third-party analytics tools (for example, App Store Connect analytics) to help us improve app performance and stability.

## Subscriptions and Payments
VibeLing offers auto-renewable subscriptions for additional features (the “Pro” version).  
All payments are handled securely through Apple’s App Store and are subject to Apple’s **Terms of Use (EULA)** and **Privacy Policy**.  
We do not process or store any payment information ourselves.

You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your App Store account settings.

- Privacy Policy (Apple): [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

## Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the limited data we handle (such as anonymized analytics) from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.

## Children’s Privacy
VibeLing is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under this age.
